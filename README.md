# CSCI212-Projects

Each project (starting from Project 1) builds off of the previous project. 

Project 0: Use the JOptionPane class and data types char and string to count the number of E's and e's in the string that the user inputs.

Project 1: Use the TextFileInput and StringTokenizer classes to store data in dynamic and static structures. Use selection sort to sort the data and display the sorted data in a basic GUI.
  
Project 2: Implement NodeLists to organize/sort the data in chronological order.  
  
Project 3: Add a menu bar and menu items to the GUI to create more options for the user. Create and handle new exceptions. Replace NodeLists with ArrayLists.

Project 4: Create a new menu that allows the user to enter a specification and return the file content that matches the specification.
